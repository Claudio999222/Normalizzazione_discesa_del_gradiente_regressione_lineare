# Linear Regression with Data Normalization and Gradient Descent

In this notebook, we will perform linear regression with data normalization and gradient descent. The key components covered in this notebook include:

1. **Linear Regression**: Implementation of the linear regression model for predictive analysis.
2. **Data Normalization**: Normalization of input features to improve convergence during gradient descent.
3. **Gradient Descent**: Application of the gradient descent optimization algorithm to minimize the cost function.
4. **Visualization**: Visualization of the regression line and cost function convergence.

## Topics Covered:

- **Feature Normalization**: Standardizing input features for improved algorithm convergence.
- **Hypothesis Function**: Formulation and application of the hypothesis function for linear regression.
- **Cost Function**: Computation of the cost function, which measures the difference between predicted and actual values.
- **Gradient Descent Iterations**: Implementation of multiple iterations of the gradient descent algorithm.
- **Visualization of Convergence**: Plotting the convergence of the cost function over iterations.

This notebook provides a practical example of linear regression with normalization and gradient descent, offering insights into the impact of these techniques on the training process.

Feel free to explore the code and accompanying explanations to gain a hands-on understanding of linear regression with data normalization and gradient descent.
